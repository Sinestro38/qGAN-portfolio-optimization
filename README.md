# Exploring the applications of QGANs to model time series data
This project takes an empirical stab at answering the question: which hyperparameters are optimal for quantum generative adversarial learning. With the application of learning consecutive equity prices, we built a proof-of-concept quantum generative adversarial network and a simple quantum neural network to accomplish the task of predicting the next four days of prices given fifteen prior days of prices. We evaluate quantum model capacity, convergence characteristics, training efficency, and more on the basis of 7 hyperparameters we tuned.
